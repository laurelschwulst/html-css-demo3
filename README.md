# Demo 2 — Text

A simple, one-page HTML & CSS site that uses ["skip" or "jump" links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#skip_links) so that all the content is on one long scrolling page.

The form is inspired by https://alt-text-as-poetry.net, a project by Finnegan Shannon & Bojana Coklyat, whose website was created by Laurel Schwulst (me) and Taichi Wi.

The content on this site is by Laurel Schwulst (me), acting as an on-ramp to thinking about how to publish on the web. No matter how we create it — "The purpose of a website is to exist!" — first and foremost, so let's decide the best way based on our needs.

Created by [Laurel Schwulst](https://laurelschwulst.com) for a workshop with the British Art Network, May 2024.
